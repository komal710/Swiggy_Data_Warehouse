**We transform data flow requirements into implementation, create fact and dimension tables, and build an interactive Streamlit dashboard.**
 Completed this end to end real life food aggregator based data engineering project (ETL or ELT) using snowflake
 - To load data using snowflakeâ€™s snowsight data loading feature without any tool dependency.
 - To load delta data set and let is go through the data pipeline and to use $ notation to query stage file.
 - To run copy command to load CSV files into tables.
 - To design different layers & fact/dimension tables.
 - To see the KPI and data insight using Streamlit.
